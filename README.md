# NASA Image and Video library search

This repo provided a search engine for the NASA photo and video library using Svelte Framework. The styling is in the theme folder, the components used on the page are under routes, and any API calls would be found in the api folder.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
